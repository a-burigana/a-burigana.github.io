summary: "The paper proposes a formulation of DEL-based epistemic planning based on a different kind of object, called possibility. We argue that the resulting framework, named DELPHIC, constitutes a valid alternative to the traditional Kripke semantics for DEL, since it provides a more compact representation of epistemic information and a lighter update mechanism."

##### Abstract:

*Dynamic Epistemic Logic* (*DEL*) provides a very expressive framework for planning, called *epistemic planning*. In this paper, we discuss the shortcomings of the traditional DEL semantics, based on Kripke models, and we propose a formulation of epistemic planning based on a different kind of object, called *possibility*. We argue that the resulting framework, named DELPHIC, constitutes a valid alternative, since it provides a more compact representation of epistemic information and a lighter update mechanism. We conclude by discussing the advantages of DELPHIC, both theoretically and in terms of implementation.
