summary: "In this paper we propose a new action description language called EPDDL (Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language), through which we can represent all kinds of DEL actions, thus allowing for a general and unified syntax for representing epistemic planning domains."

##### Abstract:

Epistemic planning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that stems from the combination of automated planning and Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL). While DEL provides a very expressive framework—which comes at the cost of undecidability—to guarantee the feasibility of the planning process, various fragments have been studied in the literature, that rely on very specific syntax for representing domains. As a result, a comprehensive language that is able to capture the general DEL framework is currently not present in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new language called EPDDL (Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language), through which we can capture the full DEL semantics, thus allowing for a general and unified syntax for representing epistemic planning domains.
