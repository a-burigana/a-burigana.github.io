description: "Epistemic Forward Planner. Solver for epistemic planning problems based on the mA* language."
summary: "EFP 2.0 is an epistemic planner that is built on top a fragment of Dynamic Epistemic Logic called $m\\mathcal{A}^*$. The fragment comprises (public and private) ontic actions and (public, private and semi-private) sensing and announcement actions. The planner implements both a Kripke semantics for the fragment and a novel alternative semantics based on objects called *possibilities*."
