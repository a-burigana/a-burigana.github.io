description: "An Answer Set Programming model of the DELPHIC semantics for DEL-based epistemic planning problems."
summary: "DELPHIC is a novel semantics for Dynamic Epistemic Logic based on an alternative representation of epistemic states called *possibilities*. DELPHIC ASP is an Answer Set Programming model of a DEL-based epistemic planner built on top of the DELPHIC semantics. Since the DELPHIC semantics comprises the full range of DEL actions, DELPHIC ASP generalizes the [PLATO](../plato/) solver."

#### Description

[DELPHIC](../../papers/2023-09-24-jelia/) is a novel semantics for Dynamic Epistemic Logic based on an alternative representation of epistemic states called *possibilities*. DELPHIC ASP is an Answer Set Programming model of a DEL-based epistemic planner built on top of the DELPHIC semantics. Since the DELPHIC semantics comprises the full range of DEL actions, DELPHIC ASP generalizes the [PLATO](../plato/) solver.
